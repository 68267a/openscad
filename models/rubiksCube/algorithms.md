# List of Rubik's Cube Algorithms 3x3
<<<<<<< HEAD
These are the algorithms that are necessary to solve the Rubik's Cube and the step in the process where they are used. For more detailed information on where and when to use these algorithms, see below.

1 | White edges | ez | make sure white edges match side tops
2 | White Corners | R' D' R | corners match edges
3a| Middle to left | U' L' U L U F U' F' |
3b| Middle to right | U R U' R' U' F' U F |
<<<<<<< HEAD
4 | Yellow cross | F R U R' U' F' | Dot > L > Line. Sides don't matter
5 | Yellow edges | R U R' U R U2 R' U | repeat for each incorrect edge piece, moves bottom to left
6a| Place yellow corners | U R U' L' U R' U' L | PLACES ONLY. Orientation not likely correct. Hold with correct corner in right thumb
6b| Orient yellow corners | R' D' R D | TURN TOP, DO NOT REORIENT.

6a| Place yellow corners | U R U' L' U R' U' L | PLACES ONLY. Orientation not licely correct. Hold with correct corner in right thumb.
6b| Orient yellow corners | R' D' R D | When yellow corner is correct, do `U`. DO NOT REORIENT CUBE.

N | Step | Algorithm | Description
-|-|-|-
1 | White | R U R' U' | Upper sides should be correct. When done, flip so white is on bottom.
2a| Position Yellow | U | Get either one correct piece or 2 correct diagonals.
2b| Position Yellow | U R U' L' U R' U' L | Repeat until positions correct (orientation could be wrong)
3 | Orient Yellow Corners | R U R' U' | When  yellow corner is correct, do `U` and repeat. DO NOT REORIENT CUBE.
