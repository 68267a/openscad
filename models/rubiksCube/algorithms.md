# List of Rubik's Cube Algorithms 3x3
N | Step | Algorithm | Description
-|-|-|-
1 | White edges | ez | make sure white edges match side tops
2 | White Corners | R' D' R | corners match edges
3a| Middle to left | U' L' U L U F U' F' | 
3b| Middle to right | U R U' R' U' F' U F | 
4 | Yellow Cross | F R U R' U' F' | Dot > L > Line. Sides don't matter
5 | Yellow Edges | R U R' U R U2 R' U | Repeat for each incorrect edge piece, moves to bottom left.
6a| Place yellow corners | U R U' L' U R' U' L | PLACES ONLY. Orientation not licely correct. Hold with correct corner in right thumb.
6b| Orient yellow corners | R' D' R D | When yellow corner is correct, do `U`. DO NOT REORIENT CUBE.

_Note: Colors are Red > Blue > Orange > Green_
N | Step | Algorithm | Description
-|-|-|-
1 | White | R U R' U' | Upper sides should be correct. When done, flip so white is on bottom.
2a| Position Yellow | U | Get either one correct piece or 2 correct diagonals.
2b| Position Yellow | U R U' L' U R' U' L | Repeat until positions correct (orientation could be wrong)
3 | Orient Yellow Corners | R U R' U' | When  yellow corner is correct, do `U` and repeat. DO NOT REORIENT CUBE.
