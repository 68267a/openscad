# Summary

This is a newer version of my [Slider Task Reminder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2068177). Now you can make a task list for things you have to do in the morning and at night!

Use the Customizer to change the text to make a task list for anything you like. Did you feed the Cats? Did you take your pills? Did you feed the Dog? 
Make one for any task you need!

The Base Plate has a flat back version and a version with a cutout for a round refrigerator magnet.
I added cutouts to the inside of the flat Bottom_Plate where you can glue 10mm or 6mm neodymium magnets.Special thanks to thingiverse user Milhooz for the idea.  

<h5>Print out the following:</h5>
1x Base Plate (flat or magnet)
1x Top Plate
14x Sliders

<h5>Assembly</h5>
Place all 14 sliders in the Base Plate tracks then snap the Top Plate in place. No glue required.
Tip: If you are having trouble snapping the top plate in place, use a small flat head screwdriver to pry the bottom plate open a bit to position the tabs in the slots. If you still have trouble, try sanding the tabs down shorter so they fit easier.

<h5>NOTE ABOUT SLIDERS</h5>
Depending on your print settings, you may need to alter the diameter of the pegs on the sliders to get a good fit. There should be just enough resistance so that they do not slide on their own. 
Use the Customizer [HERE](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2334282) to do this. 

Glue a magnet or use double sided tape to attach the task list to any surface.

<h5>UPDATED FILES</h5>
I have now added an OpenScad file of the bottom plate. It is setup so you can easily change the height, width, and wall thickness. Do the same with the top plate file to customize your lists even more.

I have also made it available as new thing: 
Use the Customizer [HERE](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3155077). 

I also made a new Customizer for the top plate to easily change the width and length:
