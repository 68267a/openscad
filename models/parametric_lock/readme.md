# Summary
This won't work on an FDM machine, but if you've got a powder machine, go for it. The tolerance is currently set for a white&strong print at shapeways, which I will be attempting in the near future.

There are cutouts so you can see how the innards work or learn to lockpick with this thing if you so desire.

Everything is parametric... at the top of the file there is a bitting array... give it some random numbers between 1 and 10, and it will make the appropriate pins and key... and you can add more numbers if you want! Have fun building a 27 pin lock!

If anybody has any advice for getting the thing to print easier or better, please let me know!

# Instructions
Size the pins and stack height according to whatever springs you have, choose your bitting, generate the files, and print them on a powder printer! Once you have, remove the lid by pinching together the two tails that stick out the back, insert springs, and replace the lid one pin at a time from back to front. If all goes well, you should be able to insert your key and open the lock.

And then click "I made one" so I will know you successfully printed it!
